# Insertion Sort
- Builds a sorted array one element at a time from left to right by iteratively inserting elements in their correct position 

## Time Complexity
- Best Case: O(n)
- Average, Worst-Case: O(n^2)

## Use Cases
- Best when you have a small number of elements to sort, or the elements in th initial collection are nearly sorted
- Most efficient when using the pointer-based strategy as opposed to swapping values, which is inefficient due to the amount of memory shifted per swap
- Also useful when you want to write as little code as possible

## Note
- Insertion sort is the only comparison-based sorting algorithm with a best case O(n) time complexity
