# Selection Sort
- Repeatedly finds the minimum and maximum element from the unsorted part of the array and swaps it with the rightmost element in the unsorted portion of the array

## Complexity
- Best Case: O(n^2)
- Worst Case: O(n^2)

## Use Cases
- Has quadratic time complexity in best and worst-case scenarios. 
- Highly ineffiecient algorithm that performs nearly the same task on each iteration
- Prefer any of the other sorting algorithms to selection sort
